# word_generator

The main purpose of this project is to generate random words in order to find out the smaller noun available in instagram.
The methodology used is based on Markov chains that allow us to generate word 'good to hear'. That mean that our algorithm can't generate words like 'awxqs'

How it work ? 

Imagine you want to create a new instagram account for your professional visibility but you have no idea how to name it. Of course, you have to find an attractive and easy-memorized name which match with work you want to share. 

The word generator algorithm can help you to find the shortest noun for you instagram account. The algorithm will learn from any documents (list, articles), pick-up some word from the source and mixed them for creating a new coherent word. For instance, you're a guitar player and your dream is to build up a new Rock'n Roll band but you don't know how to name it. Bunch of word will be generated by learning articles speaking about Queen or Rock in 60's.
All you have to do is :

- Make sure your python version are update to 3.7.1 
- Launch the main.py and choose your topic and the size of your noun
- Open csv file which contain all the noun generated and the availability in instagram
