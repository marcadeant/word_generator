# word_generator

The main purpose of this project is to generate random words in order to find out the smaller noun available in instagram.
The methodology used is based on Markov chains that allow us to generate word 'good to hear'. That mean that our algorithm can't generate words like 'awxqs'

How it work ? 

Imagine you want to create a new instagram account for your professional visibility but you have no idea how to name it. Of course, you have to find an attractive and easy-memorized name which match with work you want to share. 

The word generator algorithm can help you to find the best noun for you instagram account. The algorithm will learn from any documents (mainly articles) and classify them in topics. Then, if you want to find a name to promote your music band in instagram, the noun (or list of nouns)
will be generated by learning articles speaking about Queen or Rock in 60's.
All you have to do is :


- Make sur your python version are update to 3.7.1
